BGP:
 - path vector routing protocoll (multi metric)
 - inter domain, Exterrior Gateway Protocol
 - Autonomous sytems (AS), iBPG inside one AS, eBGP between AS-es
 - routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets
 - uses TCP as its transport for control plane

OSPF:
 - link state routing protocoll
 - intra-domain, Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
 - link state advertisements and proagation on L3 (IP connectivity between routers)
 - once all links are known map is generated of the full network and based on that routing table is populated
 - Dijsktra algo
 - hierarchy, areas

RIP:
 - distance vector routing protocoll
 - intra-domain, Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
 - similar to xSTP in Ethernet (but that uses Dijsktra algo, this one uses Bellman-Ford algo)
 - Each node sends its routing table and hop count (and maybe other metrics) for each destination
 - interface with the least distance towards the destination is entered into the routing table


IS-IS:
 - link state routing protocoll
 - intra-domain, Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
 - link state advertisements but flooded on L2
 - once all links are known map is generated of the full network and based on that routing table is populated
 - Dijsktra algo
 - hierarchy, areas

With distance-vector, routers shared the distance metric among each other and that adds up (e.g. number of hops)
With path-vector, routers share the entire path for each destination => possible to:
 - see loops (myself in the path)
 - apply path policies (dont go through Iran even if thats the shortest...)
