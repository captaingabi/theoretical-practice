router-rtpes:
 - internal router (inside area)
 - backbone router (in area 0)
 - ABR = Area Border Router (between areas)
 - ASBR = Autonomous System Border Router (on Area edge where other Routing protocoll also runs)

tables:
 - Neighbour
 - Topology = LSDB
   - each antry is an LSA (Link State Advertisement)
 - Routing

control-packets:
 - Hello
 - DBD (LSA summary)
 - LSR (Link State request)
 - LSU (Link State update)
 - LSA ack

link-choice:
 - longest prefix match
 - AD (administrative distance)
 - cost metric = sum of link costs
   - link cost = reference bandwidtth (configurable) / interface bandwidth
   - default reference-bandwidth = 100 Mbps => Fast Ethernet cost = 1


hello-packet:
 - router-id (not an ip address, but 23 bytes)
 - hello interval
 - dead interval
 - neighbours
 - area id
 - auth data (pass, hash)
 - network mask
 - area type
 - DR (Designated router)
 - BDR (Vackup designated router)
 - Priority (for DR and BDR)

DBD:
 - master-slave election, then master asks, slave replies

adjacency:
 - down (multicast hello)
 - attempt (unicast hello for non-broadcast network types)
 - init (got hello)
 - 2-way (see neighbour from hello)
 - exstart (DBD masgter election)
 - exchange (DBD, LSA summary exchange)
 - loading (LSR-LSU-LSAck)
 - full

LSA-types:
 - type 1 = router LSA: intra area, sent by all
 - type 2 = Network LSA: intra area, sent by DR
 - type 3 = summary LSA: inter area, sent by ABR
 - type 4 = ASBR Summary LSA: between areas, sent by ABR
 - type 5 = external LSA: on area edge to external protocolls, sent by ASBR
 - type 7 = external NSSA LSA: on area edge only NSSA areas, to external protocolls, converted to type 5 on ABR

areas:
 - area 0 alwyas invlolved = start topology
 - normal                 (LSA 1 2 3 4 5)
 - Stub                   (LSA 1 2 3 + default GW for external routes)
 - Totally Stub           (LSA 1 2 + default GW for external routes and area0 routes)
 - Not So Stub            (LSA 1 2 3 7 + amdmin choice of default GW for external routes)
 - Totally Not So Stub    (LSA 1 2 7 + amdmin choice of default GW for external and area0 routes)
