neighbourship:
 - formed by static manual configuration pointing BGP routers to each other between AS-es
 - TCP session on port 179
 - advertises:
   - Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) = prefixes + length
   - path-attributes (PA) for path selection (multi metric choice) both inbound and outbound

Autonomous System (AS):
 - ASN (Autonomous System Number)
 - Confederation = sub-AS, same concept as Areas in OSPf
   -  only need full mesh inside sub-AS

Route Reflector: same concept as Designagted Router in OSPF

Open message:
 - version
 - local ASN
 - hold time (default 180 sec)
 - router id
 - optional params

keepalive message:
 - 60 sec
 - when holdtime reached, neighbourship tears down

Update message:
 - withdrawn routes
 - NLRI
 - path attributes

Notification message:
 - error info, code subcode

path-selection (in order):
 - do not consider path if no route to next hop
 - highest weight
 - heighest local preference (global within AS)
 - prefer locally originated routes (BGP install itself rather than redistribution, have 0.0.0.0 as next-hop)
 - shortest AS path length (number of AS-es)
 - lowest origin code (IGP < EGP < incomplete)
 - lowest MED multi exit discriminator (for same AS)
    - note: below 2 config can be enabled/disabled independently making 4 possible choice
    - cisco deterministic-med: groups AS-entries, gets the best entry for each As, and continues the comparison between those bets entries.
    - cisco always-comapre: by default different AS entries not compared, this will compare them too.
 - prefer eBGP path over iGBP path (we go out to other AS anyway, lets not move inside more, go out immediately)
 - path with lowest IGP metric to next hop
 - router-id (originator-id for reflected routes)
 - shortest cluster-list (when route-reflectors present)
 - lowest next-hop address (tie breaker)
